CONSUMER COMPLAINT AGAINST XYZ ELECTRONICS FOR DEFECTIVE PRODUCT

Respectfully Sheweth:

1. Statement of Facts:

   a. That the Complainant, [Your Name], is a consumer as defined under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.

   b. That the Respondent No. 1, XYZ Electronics Private Limited, is engaged in the business of selling electronic goods and maintaining its stores and is responsible for the products sold through its channels.

   c. That the Respondent No. 2, Mr. Rajesh Kumar, is the Store Manager of XYZ Electronics Store #456 and acted on behalf of Respondent No. 1 in the transaction with the Complainant.

   d. That on April 15, 2024, the Complainant purchased a smartphone, Model: Galaxy S23, from XYZ Electronics Store #456 for a sum of ₹75,000 (Rupees Seventy-Five Thousand Only). (Copy of Purchase Receipt attached as Evidence-A).

   e. That the aforementioned smartphone came with a standard manufacturer's warranty (Copy of Warranty Information attached as Evidence-B).

   f. That within only three (3) days of normal usage after the purchase date, the Complainant observed severe defects in the smartphone, including excessive battery drain and overheating issues. The Complainant was unable to use the smartphone for its intended purpose due to these defects. (Photographic Evidence of defects attached as Evidence-C).

   g. That on April 20, 2024, the Complainant contacted XYZ Electronics Store #456, explained the defects, and requested a replacement of the defective smartphone.

   h. That the Respondent No. 2, Mr. Rajesh Kumar, refused to provide a replacement and instead offered a repair option which would take approximately 3-4 weeks. This is unacceptable to the Complainant, given that the defects manifested within a very short period after purchase.

2. Violation of Consumer Rights:

   a. That the actions of the Respondents constitute a clear violation of the Complainant's consumer rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.

   b. That Section 59 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, guarantees that consumers are entitled to a replacement or refund for goods that are found to be substantially defective within the warranty period. The defects in the Complainant's smartphone are substantial and directly affect its functionality.

   c. That the refusal of the Respondents to provide a replacement constitutes unfair trade practices and deficiency in service.

3. Relief Sought:

   In light of the above mentioned facts and circumstances, the Complainant prays that this Hon'ble Commission be pleased to:

   a. Direct the Respondents to replace the defective Galaxy S23 smartphone with a new, functional device of the same model and specifications.
   
   OR
   
   b. Direct the Respondents to refund the entire purchase price of ₹75,000 (Rupees Seventy-Five Thousand Only) to the Complainant.

   c. Direct the Respondents to pay compensation to the Complainant for the mental agony, harassment, and inconvenience caused due to the defective product and the unfair trade practices, the amount of which may be reasonably assessed by this Hon'ble Commission.

   d. Direct the Respondents to pay the cost of litigation.

   e. Pass any other order(s) as this Hon'ble Commission may deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case.

4. Supporting Evidence:

   a. Evidence-A: Copy of Purchase Receipt
   b. Evidence-B: Copy of Warranty Information
   c. Evidence-C: Photographic Evidence of Defects

Prayer:

Wherefore, it is most respectfully prayed that this Hon'ble Commission may be pleased to admit this complaint, issue notice to the Respondents, and pass such orders as deemed fit and proper in the interest of justice.
